# Homelessness Analysis  
## Description  
In this project we want to look into homelessness and analyze different factors on the different kinds of homelessness and what factors could lead to them. We will be using various modeling methods such as Lasso and Ridge regression as well as Decision Trees to predict homelessness. We will also be looking into whether it is better to use the homeless rate or the log of the homeless rate in are calculations.  
The software we are using it Juypter Notebook  

## Data  
05b_analysis_file_update.csv  
HUD TO3 - 05b Analysis File - Data - Dictionary.csv  
These files are taken from HUD's report Market Predictors of Homelessness. The HUD TO3 dictionary is a description of all variables in the data set

## Data Preperation - Li_Homelessness_Data_Preparation.ipynb
In this file we cleaned the data for ease of use. We first reduce the amount of columns we look at, then we renamed them to more easy to make them easier to understand and the removed empty and irrelevant data. The cleaned data file is clean_homeless_data.csv
